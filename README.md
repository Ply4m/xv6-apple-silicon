## Getting Started

To get started, download the latest release of the project from our [Releases section](https://github.com/Ply4m/xv6-apple-silicon/releases). You will find the necessary files to build and run the operating system.

## Prerequisites

Before you dive in, make sure you have the following installed on your Apple Silicon device:

- **Homebrew**: A package manager for macOS. If you don't have it, you can install it using the following command in your terminal:

  ```bash
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```

- **QEMU**: An open-source emulator that allows you to run the xv6 operating system. You can install it via Homebrew:

  ```bash
  brew install qemu
  ```

- **RISC-V Toolchain**: This is necessary for building the xv6 OS. Install it using Homebrew:

  ```bash
  brew tap riscv/riscv
  brew install riscv64-unknown-elf
  ```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ply4m/xv6-apple-silicon.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:

   Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd xv6-apple-silicon
   ```

3. **Build the Project**:

   Compile the xv6 OS by running:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This command will generate the necessary files to run the operating system.

## Running xv6

Once you have built the project, you can run xv6 using QEMU. Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
make qemu
```

This will launch the xv6 operating system in a QEMU window. You can now interact with it as if it were running on actual hardware.

## Features

- **Multi-Process Support**: xv6 allows multiple processes to run concurrently, showcasing basic operating system features.
- **File System**: The project includes a simple file system, enabling file operations within the OS.
- **Shell**: A basic shell is included, allowing users to execute commands.
- **User Programs**: Several example user programs demonstrate the capabilities of the OS.
